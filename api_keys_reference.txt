# This file provides instructions on how to configure your API keys for local development.
# These keys are essential for the application's AI features (Gemini) and Google Sign-In functionality.

# --- Environment Variable Setup ---

# 1. Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of this project.
#    The `.env` file is used to store environment-specific variables and is typically ignored by Git.

# 2. Add the following lines to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values
#    with your actual keys:

VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE

#    - VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY: Your API key for Google Gemini (for AI-powered features).
#    - VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: Your Google Client ID for enabling Google Sign-In.

# 3. Important Security Note:
#    Ensure that your `.env` file is listed in your project's `.gitignore` file.
#    This prevents your sensitive API keys from being accidentally committed to version control.
#    Vite projects usually include `.env` in `.gitignore` by default, but it's good practice to verify.
#    DO NOT commit the `.env` file containing your actual keys to any public or private repository.

# --- Old Configuration (index.html - Deprecated) ---
# The previous method of placing API keys in a `window.APP_CONFIG` object within `index.html`
# is no longer used. Please use the `.env` file method described above.
# You can safely remove any `APP_CONFIG` script block from your local `index.html` if you haven't already.

# This `api_keys_reference.txt` file itself can be safely committed to version control as it
# no longer holds sensitive keys and only provides instructions.
